# Physics & Mathematics Student

```Hi! My name is MƒÅni (pronounced basically like üí∏). I am currently an undergraduate science student @ USyd, majoring in Maths and Physics. I am highly interested in the latest Quantum as well as Astrophysics research and keep myself updated with the latest work in Physics. I am only just getting started with research but I would be interested and open to potential collaborations.```

## Relevant Experience

#### The Double-Slit Delayed-Choice Experiment Theoretical Analysis | (_2022-2023_)
The very fundamental mysteries within Quantum Mechanics are closely tied to the model's departures from a classical theory of light. In two series of reports (with potential publishing soon), we analyse John A. Wheeler's analogue of the famous Double-Slit experiment. We demonstrated in paper (1) that a variation of the experiment can be analysed completely classically using a proposed theoretical MZI setup. In paper (2), we specifically focused on Wheeler's initial analysis and showed that a non-retrocausal explanation is possible. The investigation was conducted under the supervision of [Dr. Angela Karanjai](https://equs.org/users/angela-karanjai).

#### Solving the Einstein Constraint Equation on Closed Manifolds | (_2023_)
[TBD]

#### [The GALAH Survey: Remodelling 'Chemical Clocks'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-f8hNVROWnfSDRsBh6U_kl_lsGF0eAUd/view?usp=sharing) | (_2022_)
The task of estimating stellar ages in the Milky Way is of great importance for Galactic Archaeologists today. In this paper, we utilised the GALAH DR4 data to investigate the further possibility of estimating stellar ages in the Milky Way through XGBoost‚Äôs gradient-boosting platform as a predictive model. The investigation was conducted under the supervision of [Dr. Michael Hayden](https://sifa.sydney.edu.au/people/), and the [SIfA](https://sifa.sydney.edu.au) team. 

#### [Genetic Algorithm Optimisation of Spectrally Filtered Single Photons from Photon Pair Sources](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dCTIcF8GGBGonhXffSXSvaUfLjUrh6QZ/view?usp=sharing) | (_2021_)
Quantum information processing is highly dependent on pure single photons. The spectral correlations possessed by parametric heralded single-photons sources lead to a trade-off between the purity and the heralding success probability. This trade-off must be optimised to create an ideal source. This paper utilises computational genetic algorithms to attempt to find the optimal filter transmission function. This investigation was conducted during high school under the supervision of Daniel Blay.



## Projects
#### The Scientist Reachout Project | (_2021-2022_)
We initiated a decision to contact various scientists across the globe, learning from the scientists‚Äô experiences. We recorded and published some of these discussions on YouTube in a podcast format for everyone to access.

#### USyd Physics Society PhysPod (_2023-Present_)
A podcast series "PhysPod" initiated by the University of Sydney Physics Soceity in which we discuss with physicists around the campus about physics, science, academia, and life!
